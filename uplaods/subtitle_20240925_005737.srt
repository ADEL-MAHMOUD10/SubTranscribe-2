00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,710
Okay, Erin, this is with narration. Thank you for enjoying this.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,686
So this is the edge of our house. It's like a weird

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,290
bunglery type thing. So there's this long drive. You come down,

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,270
it's semi detached. That's next door. This is all us. So it's

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,206
very odd. So it's dining point. Really ugly entrance, bizarre colour.

6
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:25,278
Hate the roof. But let's keep going. So when

7
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:29,540
you walk along here, that's our garage. Then there's a separate entrance here

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,944
for a standalone, like, let's call it

9
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:37,580
Granny flat. And then along here.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,000
And again, we hate all this. It's really ugly. Maybe we extend

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,104
here. Who knows? Along here is the main

12
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:48,700
entrance. This is my daughter, as smiling as ever.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,762
And then. So this is the hall. Ignore the greenhouse

14
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:57,642
sky. Don't worry about that. This is the main entrance.

15
00:00:57,786 --> 00:01:01,810
So on the left hand side, we have. There's currently

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,962
a weird utility room. Because the kitchen is so small, there's no room.

17
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,030
We think we're going to make this a study.

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,442
So, very odd. And next to it,

19
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,470
very small bathroom, as in toilet.

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,884
Okay. And then we go, right, so this is the main entrance.

21
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:23,480
So big fireplace

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,020
here. There's also a fireplace here. There's two.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,304
This is currently a lounge. Very strange size, doesn't quite function.

24
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:37,080
Ignore the mess. It's very messy. So lounge,

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,460
kind of an awkward size. That's just a tiny cupboard.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,460
That's the side entrance. That is outside.

27
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,800
And then this wall, which we've often thought about knocking down,

28
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,840
go through to a very small kitchen.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,360
This is curly. This is a very small kitchen.

30
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,828
And then this is the outside. This is where we bought the house. It's got

31
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:04,240
a really good garden, especially for central Brighton.

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,560
And so the idea is that we think what we'd like to do,

33
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,861
perhaps, is some kind of massive extension. So I

34
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:16,245
say massive. An extension. So, as you see, really ugly,

35
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:20,009
ugly, ugly, ugly. And then the idea is that there is

36
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:24,117
potential to go out, maybe to here, all the way along there, and make

37
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:27,813
one kind of grand room of some shape or form. So this is the side

38
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:28,609
entrance.

39
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,941
It goes out to back where we started. And then

40
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:38,369
this is where the house gets even stranger. So a small kitchen.

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,992
Not going to worry about upstairs because I don't think we're going to change anything

42
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:46,568
upstairs but this bit.

43
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:50,240
So there's this

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,088
door and then we basically have a

45
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:57,960
standalone bathroom, which we think would make sense as a utility room

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,632
because we're not quite sure whether there's another bathroom down here. This is under the

47
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:04,960
stairs. There's nothing there. Now on the left,

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,124
this is the standalone granny flat that we saw from the other side.

49
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,052
So this is a sensibly sized standalone thing with

50
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:16,520
a toilet. And that's the outside bit that you saw before.

51
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,772
And then this corridor, again, all dead space with

52
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:26,036
a number of spaces that make no sense. So there's a

53
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:30,396
storagey thing there and then this

54
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:34,020
second storage thing there, and then you have this room,

55
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,182
again, not making an awful lot of sense. So I think

56
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:42,078
the challenge is none

57
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:45,130
of it is very efficient. I think it's probably the easiest way to describe it.

58
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,170
And,

59
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,678
yeah, which walls we knock through. So whether it's this wall going to the kitchen,

60
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:55,166
clearly the kitchen needs to be longer. And this is a south facing garden,

61
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:59,278
but you wouldn't know with the light, because it's not

62
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:03,046
really being used to its best effect. So I think what we'd like

63
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:07,422
is some kind of extension thing there and

64
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:10,798
then some kind of refiguring of all of this. And the challenge is

65
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:13,890
just doing it in a cost effective way that makes any sense.

66
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,210
And as I said, the two architects we've had come look have said,

67
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,126
yeah, don't do the extension. This is big enough footprint. Just rejig

68
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:25,806
it. And a, I'm not convinced, and b, they didn't seem

69
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:29,400
to have an elegant answer on the what that would actually mean.

70
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,484
So, as I said, my preference would be that we do something

71
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:38,876
that takes us out here in some way, makes this less ugly and

72
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:42,388
makes it interesting. But the core guest requirement is we want a

73
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:44,000
grand room of some shape or form.

74
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,620
So I'll send it to you now. Thank you for enduring hope. That makes some

75
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:48,780
sense.
